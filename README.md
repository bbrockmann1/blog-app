# Blog App

Welcome to Blog App! Blog App is a full stack web application where users can sign up and write blogs. The backend is a full CRUD API using Rails version 7.0.4. The front end is written in JavaScript/React. This is my capstone project for Flatiron's Software Engineering course all written within three weeks.

## Users can... 
* Be signed up and can log in/log out.
* Create, edit, and delete their own blog posts.
* Add tags to a post.
* Search for blog posts and tags.
* Review other userâ€™s blog posts.
